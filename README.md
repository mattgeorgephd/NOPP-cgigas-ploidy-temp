# NOPP-gigas-ploidy-temp

Data from [NOPP](https://www.nopp.org/) funded project investigating impact of marine heatwaves (temperature and/or desiccation) on diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) pacific oysters. 
The following experiments took place at the University of Washington and the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Hatchery over the course of Winter 2020 - Fall 2021:

1. 202101_PILOT - initial laboratory investigation: effect of elevated water temp on juvenile 2n/3n oyster respiration and mortality
2. 202104_EXP1 - first hatchery experiment: effect of elevated water temp (2C d-1 to 30C) on 2n/3n oyster condition, respiration, transcriptomics, feeding, and mortality
3. 202107_EXP2 -  second hatchery experiment: effect of elevated water temp (2C d-1 to 30C), followed by desiccation stress (44C for 4h) on 2n/3n oyster condition, respiration, transcriptomics, feeding, and mortality
